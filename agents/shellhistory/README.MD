Overview

This Go program prompts the user to decide whether they want to fetch the history of commands executed in the shell. Based on the user’s response, it either prints a placeholder message or skips to reading and displaying the content of the .zsh_history file.
Features

    User Input: Asks the user if they want to fetch the shell history with a yes/no prompt.
    Conditional Execution:
        If the user inputs yes or y, the program prints a placeholder message for the history command (note: the actual execution of the history command is not implemented).
        If the user inputs no, it exits without executing further commands.
        For any other input, it prints an invalid input message and exits.
    File Reading: Reads the content of the .zsh_history file from the user’s home directory and prints its content.

Code Structure

    Imports: Utilizes bufio, fmt, os, and strings packages for user input, error handling, and file operations.
    User Prompt: Reads user input and handles different responses.
    File Handling: Reads and prints the content of the .zsh_history file.

Usage

    Run the program.
    When prompted, enter yes or y to proceed with fetching history, or no to skip the history fetching process.
    The program will display the content of the .zsh_history file if the history command is skipped.
